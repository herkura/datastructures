 ## Arrays
 An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. 
 The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value, i.e., the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array).
 The base value is index 0 and the difference between the two indexes is the offset.
 
 For simplicity, we can think of an array as a fleet of stairs where on each step is placed a value

### Applications on Array

* Array stores data elements of the same data type.
* Arrays can be used for CPU scheduling.
* Used to Implement other data structures like Stacks, Queues, Heaps, Hash tables, etc.
