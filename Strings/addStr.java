//Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.
//eg1: num1 = " 11"
//     num2 = "123" 
//output : "134"
//The approach to solve this problem will be same as that in adding binary
//the only difference is that in this the input is in decimal NOT binary
